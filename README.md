# KeyDock

This is a project designed to prevent people from locking themselves out.

## Logic Flow
- You come home → you place your keys on the KeyDock (metal contact / magnet sensor).
- System goes into "armed" mode (ready to remind you next time).
- You open the door → reed switch detects the door opening.
- If the key is not docked at that moment → buzzer sounds for ~5-10 seconds.
- If the key is docked → no sound.
